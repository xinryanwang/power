        <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>In the power systems control group, we are researching in 4 main themes: 
        <A href="#ev">"Electric Vehicles"</A>,&nbsp; 
        <A href="#motor">&quot;Electric Machines and Drives&quot;</A>,&nbsp; 
        <A href="#power">&quot;Power Systems and Power Electronics&quot;</A>,&nbsp;
        <A href="#control">&quot;Automatic Control&quot;</A>. </p>

        <P class="auto-style1">Recently, due to environmental and energy concerns, 
            hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles, have been receiving more and more attention. 
            Electric motor has much faster torque response than combustion engines, 
            which allows feedback control to be applied. Our main focus is to develop more efficient, 
            economical and reliable feedback control technologies for the electric vehicles.

        <P class="auto-style1">The key technology for motion control of electrified vehicle is 
            the speed control of AC motors. The permanent magnet polyphase synchronous 
            motors offer significant advantages over the conventional polyphase synchronous 
            and induction machines due to their lower weight and volume, as well as their 
            simpler construction, and their potential amenabilities to designs with very 
            high efficiencies. One challenging aspect of this research area is its 
            multidisciplinary nature. The fundamentals of solid state devices, integrated 
            circuits, control theory, computer simulation, microprocessors, circuit theory 
            and electric machines are all brought into play before a satisfactory design can 
            be realized. The motivation of our research is to focus on the modeling, 
            analysis, design and control of induction and permanent magnet machines with 
            adjustable speed drives. Advanced embedded systems technologies involving Texas 
            Instrument DSP and Xilinx/Altera FPGA are used for development of the motor drive 
            systems.</P>

      <P>Smart power grid is a modernized electric power grid that uses communication, 
          control technologies to gather and act on information, such as information about 
          the behaviors of suppliers and consumers, in an automated fashion to improve the 
          efficiency, reliability, economics, and sustainability of the production and 
          distribution of electricity. In the smart power grid systems, the 
          renewable energy resources are connected to the grid as distributed energy 
          resources. Our research topics include: Power Systems Estimation, Distribution 
          and Transmission, Power System Design and Analysis, Protective Relays, Power Electronics and 
          Control for Wind and Photovoltaic Energy Generation and Distribution Systems, Convex Optimization 
          and Control for Smart Grid, Generator Protection and Control.</P>

      <P> The work performed is focused on the creation of new control technologies 
          which reveal advanced systems such as advanced vehicles, robotics and smart grid. 
          We place a strong emphasis both on theoretic research and experimentation 
          for addressing fundamental and open real-world technological problems. 
          Specifically, our research is focused on: Optimal and Robust Control, Nonlinear 
          Control, Adaptive Control, Model Predicative Control, Nonlinear Programming and Convex Optimization.</P>
