            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
                <p> Dr. Xin Wang is invited to delivers a presentation "Trends of Control and Estimation Research in Electrical Motor Drives and High-Power Converters" to Woodward Inc. The presentation provides an overview of the trends of control and estimation research for variable frequency motor drives and high-power converters. Advanced control and estimation methods such as model predictive control, sliding mode control, and nonlinear Kalman filtering, are applied for modern AC electrical motor drives and high-power converters, with applications in vehicle electrification and smart grid. Aiming at providing an overview of current and previous research outcomes at SIUE, we also cover a wide range of related topics including electric machines modelling, design and control; hybrid electric vehicles powertrain; advanced power systems protection; smart power converters; renewable energy resources grid integration; and innovations in electromechanical energy conversions. </p>
